# advent-2023-go
Joel's first Advent of Code &amp; Joel's first Go project

I've heard good things about Go, so participating in this year's AoC seemed like a good way to learn how to code in it.

I might set up something fancy at some point, but right now you run code like:
```shell
cd src/advent/days
go run 1.go
```
